            <h3>ABOUT US</h3>

            The Chinatown Afterschool program is the only free afterschool program in Chinatown, providing over 50 children annually with the educational tools and skills to be successful leaders of their community and the world.  Our program believes that access to educational opportunities and academic enrichment are key to building strong leaders. The language barrier is a huge impediment to seeking a job in the American workforce. Unfortunately, many of our students are the sons and daughters of immigrant parents with weak English skills. As such, these kids depend on our program to provide the reading practice and homework help that they cannot receive at home. By improving literacy and English language skills, we can give our students a shot at a better future.
            <br><br>Our program creatively combats poverty through educational projects and initiatives that prepare our students to become leaders and better citizens. The joint Harvard-Wellesley-MIT program is a valuable opportunity for student outreach to an underserved community in Boston, allowing students to brainstorm new ways to teach and inspire our kids. Every week, Monday through Thursday, our counselors develop exciting projects to provide academic enrichment and reinforce concepts learned in the classroom. These projects are a key component of our program and distinguish us from other afterschool programs offered in Chinatown. Through these projects we seek to not only challenge the participants, but our college student volunteers as well. Our students and volunteers together explore, learn actively, and expose each other to different learning styles. All of this makes learning fun for both the students and the volunteers! Without funding for materials, we could not design such creative and hands-on projects.
            <h3>OUR MISSION STATEMENT</h3>
            The Chinatown Afterschool Program seeks to promote academic enrichment for children of low-income families in Bostonâ€™s Chinatown community. We strive to provide a safe and supportive afterschool environment through tutoring, educational projects, and literacy activities. We also aspire to build self-esteem and intellectual curiosity by fostering mentoring relationships with volunteers both in and out of the classroom. Ultimately, we aim to equip our students with life skills that will encourage them to be contributing members of their communities.
