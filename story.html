            <div id = 'what'>
                For 30 years, our mission has been to provide a free and impactful afterschool program to kids
                in Chinatown's public schools. Each week from <span>Monday to Thursday from 4 to 6PM</span>, our counselors
                head out to Chinatown to mentor elementary school kids with homework help and enrichment projects.
                Each counselor comes <span>once a week</span> and we have <span>vans from Harvard and Wellesley</span>.

            <div id = 'why'>
                <span>Why do we do it?</span> It's so vital for kids to get support in math, science, and
                literacy outside of school in order to build a sturdy foundation, and there's no greater
                honor than passing on some of the amazing opportunities we had growing up to these incredible kids.
