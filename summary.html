            <h3>DAILY SUMMARY</h3>
            <div>
                Summaries are due the day that you attend program. The sooner you do it,
                the fresher the memories will be, and thus the better your summary will
                be! These should only take about 10-15 minutes to write out, and they
                are super important to keep all of the counselors in your grade in the
                loop.
